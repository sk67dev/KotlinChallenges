# Kotlin Challenges :computer:



**KOTLIN CODING CHALLENGES**
This repository contains a set of Kotlin coding challenges together with the solutions.

**Challenge Questions:**
All of the challenges are listed below.

**Solutions:**
The inks to solutions are provided below the questions.

CHALLENGES:

**1. Add, Subtract, Multiply Or Divide:**
    Write a function that takes two numbers and returns if they should be added, subtracted, 
    multiplied or divided to get 24. If none of the operations can give 24, print a 
    string to reflect this.
  
  **[Solution](src/AddSubtractMultiplyOrDivide.kt)**

**2. Area of triangle:**
    Write a function that takes the base and height of a triangle and print its area.
    
  **[Solution](src/AreaOfTriangle.kt)**
   
**3. Check Num:** 
    Have the function ```checkNum(num1,num2)``` take both parameters being passed and return the 
    string true if num2 is greater than num1, otherwise return the string false.
    If the parameter values are equal to each other then return the string -1.
    
  **[Solution](src/CheckNum.kt)**

**4. Compare Strings:**
    Create a function that takes two strings as arguments and return either true or false 
    depending on whether the total number of characters in the first string is equal to the 
    total number of characters in the second string.
    
  **[Solution](src/CompareStrings.kt)**

**5. Concatenate Arrays:** :
    Create a function to concatenate two integer arrays.
    
  **[Solution](src/ConcatenateArrays.kt)**

**6. Count The Vowels:**
    Create a function that takes a string and print the number of vowels contained within it.
    
  **[Solution](src/CountTheVowels.kt)**
    
  **7. Date & Time:** :date:
    - Print the current date and time in default format.
    - Print the current date and time in localised style.
    - Print the current date and time with a pattern.
    
  **[Solution](src/DateAndTime.kt)**
 
 **8. Divisible by 5:**
    Create a function that prints true if an integer is divisible by 5, and false otherwise.
    
  **[Solution](src/DivisibleBy5.kt)**

**9. Factorial:**
    This challenge requires you to return the factorial of a given number. A factorial of a number 
    (num), is num multiplied by (num-1) multiplied by (num-2) and so forth until you reach the number 1. 
    For example, the factorial of 4 is 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 24. Loop from 1 to num, multiplying each number by 
    the previous one, until you reach the number.
    
  **[Solution](src/Factorial.kt)**
 
 **10. Fibonacci:**
    The Fibonacci Sequence is a sequence of numbers whose sum is the two preceding numbers (e.g. 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, etc). 
    Using 0 and 1 as the starting values, create a function that prints an array containing all of the Fibonacci 
    numbers up to 10000.
    
  **[Solution](src/Fibonacci.kt)**

**11. FizzBuzz:**
    Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100. But for multiples of three print “Fizz” instead of 
    the number and for the multiples of five print “Buzz”. For numbers which are multiples of both three and five 
    print “FizzBuzz”.
    
  **[Solution](src/FizzBuzz.kt)**

**12. Capitalize Letters:** 
    Create a function that converts the first character of each word to uppercase. Print the newly formatted string.
    
  **[Solution](src/LetterCapitalize.kt)**
    
**13. Multilpy and Skip:**
    Print the multiples of 5 whilst skipping the multiples of 3.
    
  **[Solution](src/MultiplySkip.kt)**
    
**14. NameChange:**    
    Change your surname using a constructor, initializer block and object instance.
    
  **[Solution](src/NameChange.kt)**
   
**15. Palindrome:**
    Given a string of text, print true or false indicating whether or not the text is a palindrome. 
    A palindrome is a word, number, or other sequence of characters which reads the same backward as forward, 
    such as "madam" or "racecar". You can also create an int palindrome.
    
  **[Solution](src/Palindrome.kt)**
    
**16. Remove Characters:**
    Remove the first and last characters from a string.
    
  **[Solution](src/RemoveFirstAndLastChar.kt)**
    
**17. Share the Pizza:** :pizza:
    Create a function that determines whether or not it's possible to share the pizza fairly given these three
    parameters:
    Total slices, Recipients, Slices each.
    It's fine not to use the entire pizza (in real life though...not really! :smile:
    Print true if the pizza can be shared equally, otherwise print false.  
    
  **[Solution](src/ShareThePizza.kt)**

**18. Sum Elements of Array:**
    Given an array of integers, find the sum of its elements.
    For example, if the ```array = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10]``` print the answer of 55 (1+2+3+4+5+6+7+8+9+10 = 55)
    
  **[Solution](src/SumElementsOfArray.kt)**
